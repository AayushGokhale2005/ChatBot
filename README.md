## Overview

This AI Chatbot project leverages natural language processing to facilitate interactive conversations with users. Built using the LangChain framework and Tkinter for the GUI, this application serves as a practical demonstration of my skills in AI, software development, and user interface design. The chatbot utilizes the **Ollama** model to generate intelligent and contextual responses.

## Features

- **Interactive Conversational Interface:** Users can engage in a dialogue with the chatbot through an intuitive GUI built with Tkinter.
- **Contextual Responses:** The chatbot maintains conversation context to provide relevant and coherent answers.
- **Simple User Input Handling:** Users can type their queries and receive instant responses from the AI.
- **Exit Functionality:** Users can easily exit the conversation by typing "exit".

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
